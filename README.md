## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- time allocation for some section
- silly mistakes, more having to do with the reading comprehension of the documentation
- a little difficult since the videos are from a previous version of xCode
- API key confusion
- Not knowing what was wrong, no errors given, so I clicked run a couple times. That surprisingly worked.
